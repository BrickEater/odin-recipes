# odin-recipes

This is the start of my first project with Odin Project. It will be, from what I can tell, the bones of a recipe website initially and I will add CSS later to fancy it up later.

This is a test for git.

I need to remember how to commit changes to GitHub.

<git --add all> seems to add all the changes to a queue
<git commit -m '...'> seems to commit the changes to a second phase of the queue with a message
<git push origin main> seems to push all the commits within the queue to the GitHub repos

A single line break doesn't seem to show up in the read me file on GitHub
